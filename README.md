Step1:
download and launch SBMFR from steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/3297420/SBMFR/ or itch.io https://peter-bruce-1.itch.io/sbmfr-godot?secret=TDfkV5OQGXL79oQRFvbwuQDlBYE (I recommend installing the itch.io app so the game will be updated automatically for you)



Step2:
Clone this repository somewhere on your machine (NOTE - you may need to "allow access" to this location or you could put it into the default folder (see PythonManagerUI))



Step3: 
open SBMFR and go to the "PythonManager" UI enter your path to python and your path to PythonScript.py (the file that will play the game)
then click the enable_python_manager checkbox




step4:
exit the pythonManager UI and go to server browser -> join the server -> go to lobby -> join a team -> start the game.
you should now see the PythonScript "playing" the game

please let me know if this didn't work for you or if any steps dont make sense/could be explained better?


step5:
start developing your bot (more instructions to follow and I reccomend using HelperFunctions.py where possible.)
